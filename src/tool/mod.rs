//! # Tools and Tool Boxes
//!
//! This module provides the core infrastructure for defining, organizing, and executing tools within the `agentai` crate.
//! It introduces the concept of a `ToolBox`, which is a collection of callable `Tool` instances.
//!
//! Agents interact with the external world by calling these `Tool`s, which encapsulate specific functionalities
//! like searching the web, interacting with external APIs, or performing calculations.
//!
//! To implement your own `ToolBox`, you have two primary options:
//!
//! 1.  **Using the `#[toolbox]` macro:** This is the recommended approach for most cases. The macro simplifies the process by
//!     automatically generating the necessary boilerplate for a `ToolBox` trait implementation based on methods defined in a struct.
//!     See [`#[toolbox]`](crate::tool::toolbox) for more details.
//!
//! 2.  **Manual implementation:** If you require finer control over the `ToolBox` behavior, you can provide your own implementation
//!     for the [`ToolBox` trait](crate::tool::ToolBox).
//!
//! Ready-to-use `ToolBox` implementations are available:
//! - [crate::tool::buildin]: Provides a set of useful built-in tools.
//! - [crate::tool::mcp]: A `ToolBox` for interacting with the MCP Client. (Requires the `mcp-client` feature).
//!
//! For examples demonstrating how to use tools and toolboxes, look into the `examples` folder.
//! Examples related to tools typically start with the `tools_*` prefix, e.g., [crate::examples::tools_mcp].
//!
//! For example demonstrating how to implement `ToolBox` trait using `#[toolbox]` macro, look into [crate::examples::tools_custom] example.

///
/// **Note:** While this struct defines a tool, actual tool invocation is handled
/// by a `ToolBox` implementing the [`ToolBox`] trait. You must use a `ToolBox`
/// to call any defined tool.

/// The `name` field is required, while `description` and `schema` are optional

/// Implementors of `ToolBox` provide a way to group related tools and expose them to the
/// agent for invocation. The `ToolBox` is responsible for defining the available tools
/// and executing them when requested.
///
/// **Important:** This trait requires the use of the [`#[async_trait::async_trait]`](https://docs.rs/async-trait) attribute macro
/// for proper asynchronous behavior and `dyn ToolBox` compatibility.
///
/// For most use cases, implementing this trait can be significantly simplified by using
/// the [`#[toolbox]`](crate::tool::toolbox) attribute macro. This macro automatically
/// generates the necessary `ToolBox` implementation for a struct based on its methods.

    /// which are used by the language model to decide which tool to call.
    ///
    /// The `schema` field of the `Tool` can be conveniently generated from Rust structs using the [`schemars`](https://crates.io/crates/schemars) crate.

    /// when the language model determines that a tool needs to be called.
    /// The `arguments` are provided as a `serde_json::Value`. You can easily deserialize this `Value`
    /// into a Rust struct (e.g., the same struct used to generate the JSON schema
    /// in `tools_definitions`) using the [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde) crate.
    /// The arguments provided by the agent will conform to the JSON schema defined for the tool.
    ///
    /// For example, to deserialize the arguments:
    /// ```rust
    /// let args: ToolArguments = serde_json::from_value(arguments)?;
    /// ```
    /// Replace `ToolArguments` with the actual struct type corresponding to your tool's schema.

    /// * `tool_name` - The name of the tool to call.
    /// * `arguments` - A JSON `Value` containing the arguments for the tool call.

    /// or a `ToolError` if the tool call fails or the tool is not found.
